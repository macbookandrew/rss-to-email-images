Fixes large images in RSS-to-email campaigns

== Description ==
Fixes large images in RSS-to-email campaigns by scaling them to a smaller size to fit most mobile screen sizes. Based on Chris Coyierâ€™s post on CSSTricks (http://css-tricks.com/dealing-content-images-email/)

== Installation ==
1. Install the plugin.
2. Append "?feed=email" to the end of your RSS feed URL (www.example.com/feed/ would become www.example.com/feed/?feed=email).
3. Use the new URL in Feedburner or your RSS-to-email distributor of choice.

1.0: basic plugin
